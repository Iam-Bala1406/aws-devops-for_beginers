Day 1 - 3: Introduction to Cloud Computing and AWS Day 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing What is cloud computing? Types of cloud (Public, Private, Hybrid) Cloud deployment models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) Benefits of cloud computing Introduction to AWS: Overview and global infrastructure



What is Cloud Computing?
Imagine you own a business and need a powerful computer to run your applications. Instead of buying expensive hardware and maintaining it yourself, what if you could rent it from someone else and access it over the internet? That’s cloud computing!

It allows you to use computing resources (like storage, servers, and databases) on demand, just like how you use electricity—pay for what you use without worrying about maintenance.

Types of Cloud Computing
There are three main types of cloud setups:

Public Cloud – Think of it like a shared apartment. You use cloud services that are available to everyone, like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. You don’t own the infrastructure; you just rent what you need.
Private Cloud – This is like having your own house. The cloud resources are dedicated only to your organization, giving more security and control.
Hybrid Cloud – A mix of both. Some data is stored in a private setup, while other tasks run on the public cloud. Think of it like owning a house but renting extra storage when needed.
Cloud Deployment Models
Cloud computing services are offered in different formats based on what you need:

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) – Renting servers, storage, and networking from a provider. It’s like renting land and building your own house. Example: AWS EC2.
PaaS (Platform as a Service) – Renting both the hardware and the environment to develop and run applications without worrying about setup. Think of it as renting a fully furnished office. Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
SaaS (Software as a Service) – Using software that is already built and maintained by someone else. It’s like subscribing to Netflix—just log in and use it. Example: Gmail, Dropbox.
Benefits of Cloud Computing
Why is everyone moving to the cloud? Here are the top reasons:

✅ Cost Savings – No need to buy expensive hardware. You pay only for what you use.
✅ Scalability – Easily increase or decrease resources based on demand.
✅ Flexibility – Access your data and applications from anywhere in the world.
✅ Security – Cloud providers invest heavily in security, protecting your data better than most companies could do on their own.
✅ Automatic Updates – No need to manually upgrade servers or software; it's done for you.

Introduction to AWS and Global Infrastructure
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the most popular cloud provider, offering 200+ services for storage, computing, databases, security, and more.

How AWS Works Globally
AWS has data centers worldwide, divided into:

Regions (large geographical areas like North America, Europe, Asia)
Availability Zones (smaller, isolated data centers within a region)
This setup ensures that AWS services are fast, reliable, and secure no matter where you are.
